# 5G-Fault-Prediction-Simulation
This project implements a closed-loop, predictive maintenance system designed for next-generation 5G networks. Unlike traditional monitoring systems that react to failures after they occur, this system utilizes Machine Learning to predict cell tower faults before service is impacted.
